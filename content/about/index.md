### Hey there!

I'm Matt Rathbun, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer and I'm based out of Detroit. By day, I'm cleaning up metrics and creating dashboards. By night, I'm wrangling Linux servers, stumbling my way through writing nix expressions, and spending more time improving my nodejs-template than actually using it.
