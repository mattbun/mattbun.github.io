# It's my website!

## Getting Started

Clone this repository with submodules

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mattbun/mattbun.github.io.git --recurse-submodules
```

Then to build and start serving the site locally

```shell
make
```

## Creating a post

```shell
make new
```

## Building the site (without serving it)

```shell
make build
```

## Oops I forgot about the submodules when cloning!

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
